# Session Summary: Azure Development Environment Setup

## Session Overview

**Date**: 2025-09-13
**Objective**: Fix build issues, run FoodX.Admin application, and configure Azure services for development environment
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed Successfully

## User Requests Completed

### 1. Build Fix and Run Application
- **Request**: "build fix all and run"
- **Action**: Cleaned build artifacts, fixed compilation issues, successfully ran application
- **Result**: Application running on http://localhost:5195

### 2. Azure Credentials Configuration
- **Request**: "chk azure credentials in azure vault and documentation- credentials"
- **Action**: Investigated Azure Key Vault connectivity and authentication issues
- **Result**: Identified tenant mismatch and implemented development-friendly solution

### 3. Development Environment Focus
- **Request**: "i want azure services to work on dev, as app isnt ready to production yet"
- **Action**: Configured dual-mode approach (direct config for dev, Key Vault for production)
- **Result**: Azure services now work seamlessly in development

### 4. Tenant Management
- **Request**: "tenant is only- microsoft sponsership. that should be my only active tenant"
- **Action**: Updated configuration to use Microsoft Sponsorship tenant (53d5a7a1-e671-49ca-a0cb-03a0e822d023)
- **Result**: Application now uses correct tenant exclusively

## Technical Issues Resolved

### Problem 1: Azure Authentication Failure
```
Error: DefaultAzureCredential failed to retrieve a token from the included credentials
Root Cause: Application expected tenant 350118a2-b385-443c-a3d3-440dd3c3fde1 but user was logged into 53d5a7a1-e671-49ca-a0cb-03a0e822d023
```

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `appsettings.Development.json` to bypass Key Vault
- Added direct credentials for development environment
- Set `UseKeyVault: false` for development mode

### Problem 2: Connection Refused Error
```
Error: ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED on localhost:5195
Root Cause: Multiple dotnet processes running simultaneously
```

**Solution Applied**:
- Killed all existing dotnet processes: `taskkill /f /im dotnet.exe`
- Restarted application with clean environment
- Verified single process listening on port 5195

### Problem 3: Tenant Configuration Mismatch
```
Error: Hardcoded references to wrong tenant ID in configuration
Root Cause: Mixed tenant IDs in different configuration files
```

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `appsettings.Development.json` with correct tenant ID
- Modified `Program.cs` to use tenant-specific authentication
- Cleaned up documentation references

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files
- ‚úÖ **appsettings.Development.json** - Added direct credentials, correct tenant ID
- ‚úÖ **Program.cs** - Conditional Key Vault configuration with tenant support

### Documentation Created
- ‚úÖ **AZURE_DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md** - Comprehensive setup guide
- ‚úÖ **AZURE_CREDENTIALS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Troubleshooting reference
- ‚úÖ **SESSION_SUMMARY_AZURE_DEV_SETUP.md** - This session summary

### Scripts and SQL
- ‚úÖ **add_missing_buyer_columns.sql** - Database schema updates for buyer profiles

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- **Application**: Running successfully on http://localhost:5195
- **Database**: Connected to Azure SQL Database (fdx-sql-prod)
- **SendGrid**: Email service configured with working API key
- **Authentication**: Bypassed for development, using direct configuration
- **Build Process**: Clean builds with manageable warning count

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Notes
- Key Vault authentication bypassed for development simplicity
- Direct credentials stored in appsettings.Development.json
- Microsoft Sponsorship tenant (53d5a7a1-e671-49ca-a0cb-03a0e822d023) configured as primary

### üîÑ Future Production Considerations
- Enable Key Vault for production deployment
- Implement proper service principal authentication
- Set up environment-specific secret management
- Configure managed identity for Azure-hosted resources

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Development-First Approach
**Decision**: Prioritize development environment stability over production-ready authentication
**Rationale**: Application not ready for production, need working development environment
**Implementation**: Conditional Key Vault usage based on environment configuration

### 2. Direct Credential Configuration
**Decision**: Store credentials directly in development configuration files
**Rationale**: Bypass complex Azure authentication issues during active development
**Security**: Acceptable for development environment, documented as temporary solution

### 3. Single Tenant Focus
**Decision**: Use only Microsoft Sponsorship tenant for all Azure services
**Rationale**: User preference to eliminate tenant confusion
**Implementation**: Updated all configuration files to reference correct tenant ID

## Commands Used for Resolution

### Build and Run
```bash
dotnet clean
dotnet build
dotnet run --launch-profile Development
```

### Process Management
```bash
tasklist | findstr dotnet
taskkill /f /im dotnet.exe
netstat -an | findstr ":5195"
```

### Azure Verification
```bash
az account show
az keyvault list --output table
az keyvault secret show --vault-name fdx-kv-poland --name SendGridApiKey
```

## Session Outcome

‚úÖ **Primary Goal Achieved**: FoodX.Admin application running successfully in development
‚úÖ **Azure Services**: Configured and working with Microsoft Sponsorship tenant
‚úÖ **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides created for future reference
‚úÖ **Build Process**: Stable and reproducible development workflow established

## Next Steps for Development Team

1. **Immediate**: Use current development setup for active development work
2. **Short-term**: Implement User Secrets for enhanced security: `dotnet user-secrets set "SendGrid:ApiKey" "value"`
3. **Medium-term**: Set up proper service principal for team development
4. **Long-term**: Implement production-ready Key Vault integration with managed identity
